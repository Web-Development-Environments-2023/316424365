<br/>
<p>
  <b>
    <h3>I was born on June 1, 1937 in Memphis, Tennessee and grew up in Mississippi, 
    where I also started my hobby of acting in school plays which later became my life's work.
    <br/>
    I grew up in a low income family of five children. My father was a barber, and my mother was a teacher.
    </h3>
  </b>
</p>
<p>
  <b>
    <h3>
    I have been married twice in my life. My first marriage was to Jeanette Adair Bradshaw, and we were together from 1967 to 1979.
    <br/>
    We have two children together, a son named Alfonso and a daughter named Dina. Later, I married Myrna Cooley-Lee, and we were together from 1984 to 2010.
    <br/>
    We adopted my step-granddaughter, Adana Haynes, who was tragically killed in 2015. My children have given me four grandchildren, and I love spending time with them.
    <br/>
    One of my granddaughters, Morgana Freeman, is even following in my footsteps as an actress.

    <h3>
    Among my many roles I am an American actor, director and narrator. I am known for my unique deep voice and I have gained my recognition from a variety of different roles 
    <br/>
    in a wide variety of film genres in which I have taken part. Throughout my career spanning over five decades, I have received many accolades.
    <br/>
    Among the many awards I have been blessed with over the years, you can find an Oscar Award, a Screen Actors Guild Award and a Golden Globe Award.
    <br/>
    I am the recipient of the 2008 Kennedy Center Honors Award, the 2011 AFI Lifetime Achievement Award, the Cecil B. Damil for 2012 and Lifetime Achievement Award of the Screen Actors Guild for 2018.

<h2><b>Some facts about me that you might not know:</b></h2>
<ul style="text-align: left; margin-left: 80px;">
  <h3>
  <li>After learning about the impact bees have on the environment and their rapid decline, I converted my farm into a bee sanctuary with 26 hives.</li>
  <li>A friend and I built a prize cabinet long before I won any prize. My friend believed that someday I would win an award for acting - which eventually became a reality.</li>
  <li>Freeman is a very charitable guy and has supported and created many foundations over the years. Some include education and resource aid for underprivileged children as well as assisting financially with natural disasters.</li>
  <li>My first narration was in the film “The Shawshank Redemption.</li>
  <li>Along with several other famous friends, we published a cookbook called "Morgan Freeman and Friends: Caribbean Cooking for a Cause", which benefited hurricane relief.</li>

          Web 3.0: Fully distributed. A decentralized social media platform where users can create and share content, and the data is stored in a decentralized network of nodes.
          <br/>
          The architecture is fully distributed, meaning content is stored on a network of nodes instead of a central server. This enables safer and more transparent sharing of
